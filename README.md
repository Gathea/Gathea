### Hi ! My name is Gaillard, Thierry Gaillard ðŸ§­

<!--
**Gathea/Gathea** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.-->

I am currently working in the world of web and digital marketing. My goal is to help companies gain a sustainable competitive advantage by supporting them in implementing their digital strategy, by being their web project manager and by developing their web marketing.

I learned to code in html, css and javascript by following free programs on the net. I was also selected in 2018 to take the Google Developer Challenge Scholarship training to learn programming in Java and selected in 2019 to take the Bertelsmann Technology Scholarship Program Applications which was a data analysis program.

I developed the [La France Ã  ma mesure](https://wwww.lafranceamamesure.com) website as well as that of the Stradige agency, specializing in digital strategy. You can find me on my personal website.

When it comes to computer literacy, I consider myself to be someone with a lot to learn from others, especially leaders who are passionate about computer coding. That's why I'm on Github.
